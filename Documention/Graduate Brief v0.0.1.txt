magicVWAP application
The objectives are to design, document and code an application that reads a file of trades and displays information relating to the trades/VWAP.  The time allowed to complete the project will be a maximum of 3 days, after which time you will be required to present your work/application.

Objective1
Write a program to read the csv trade file and calculate the VWAP in two ways
Per unique stock / trade type combination
Per stock


Objective 2
Provide an option to save the above results in 2 new separate files, 1 for each data set, in a similar format to the input data


Objective 3
As per objective 2, but using a different data format (of your choice)


Objective 4
Provide a simple interface to be able to
Allow selection(filtering) and input of an Epic
Display the overall VWAP and the VWAP per trade type for that stock in an innovative way


Objective 5
What other data/calculations might be of interest apart from VWAP?


Objective 6
comment on any aspects of the data that strike you



Definition of VWAP (Volume weighted average)
The VWAP is simply the average price of stock, in a period of time, based on

(total value of shares traded)
---------------------------------------
(total volume of shares traded)

So, if you have 2 trades

1000 shares at œ2.00
4000 shares at œ2.50

The VWAP is	

(1000 * œ2.00) + (4000 * œ2.50)
---------------------------------------
(1000 + 4000)

= œ2.40
